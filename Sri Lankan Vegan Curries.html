        <p><h4><u>Cooking instructions:</u></h4></p>
        <p>2.Place the cashews in a bowl and cover with room temperature water. Add the salt and mix to dissolve. Cover and leave the cashews to soak overnight (up to 24 hours). 300 g raw cashews,1 tsp salt</p>
        <p>3.When you're ready to cook the cashews, drain them and set aside.</p>
        <p>4.Heat about a tbsp or two of oil (you can use coconut oil or a neutral tasting oil) in a medium-sized saucepan, over medium heat.</p>
        <P>5.Add the chopped onions and saute until translucent. ½ medium onion</P>
        <P>6.Add the garlic, bay leaves/curry leaves and saute for a few minutes until it becomes fragrant. 2 cloves garlic,8 curry leaves</P>
        <P>Add the soaked and drained cashews, turmeric, curry powder, cayenne pepper, sugar and a generous pinch of salt and the coconut milk. Mix to combine. 300 g raw cashews,2½ tsp Sri Lankan curry powder,½ tsp cayenne pepper,½ tsp sugar,1 ½ cups good quality coconut milk,Salt,¼ tsp turmeric powder</P>
        <P>7.Cover and let it simmer for 45 - 50 minutes. Check from time to time to make sure there's enough liquid in the saucepan - add water if needed. Add salt to taste. Salt</P>
        <P>8.When the cashews are cooked, they should be firm on the outside, but not crunchy when eaten. They should be almost al dente in texture but be creamy when eaten.</P>
        <P>9.Add some water if the gravy is too thick (I add about ½ cup of water). Add the frozen peas and cook until the peas are heated and cooked through and the gravy is simmering - about 10 more minutes. 1 cup frozen peas</P>
        <P>10.Serve warm with rice. This can be made a couple of days ahead and it actually tastes better on the second day. Leftovers can be reheated.</p><br>
