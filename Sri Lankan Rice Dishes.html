            <p>Clean the rice and rinse three times. Put in a pot, add cold water. The ratio should be for 1 portion of rice put 2 portions of water. Do not stir it and cook covered until the water disappears. It lasts about 25 minutes, depending on the heat. The heat should be high first and as soon as the water starts boiling, reduce the heat. Then take off the fire, let rest uncoverd about 5 minutes to let the last bits of water evaporate and mix. Serve with various kind of curries.</p><br>

            <p><h4><u>Ingredients:</u></h4></p>
            <p>2 cups "Kekulu" Rice (Substitute : Basmati, Jasmine),3 3⁄4 cups Water,400 milliliters Thick coconut milk ( 400ml = 1 2/3 cups = 1 can),2 teaspoons Salt</p>

            <p><h4><u>Cooking instructions:</u></h4></p>
            <p>1.Wash your rice first, then drain water and put it into the rice cooker or instant pot (which is what I use here) or any pot you cook your rice usually.</p>
            <p>2.Add water and 1 tsp salt (keep rest of the salt for after). Cook your rice using your usual method. If you're using a rice cooker, turn on the cook switch. If you're using an instant pot, press the rice preset. All you do here is cook rice the normal way but with just a little bit of water than you’d normally use.</p>
            <p>3.Get your thick coconut milk (I use one 400ml can for 2 cups of rice) and the rest of the salt to it and dissolve well. Taste it and it should taste a little salty. If you have tasted Kiribath before your coconut milk should have a similar taste to Kiribath now. Adjust salt to your liking. </p>
            <p>4.Add the coconut milk to the cooked rice as soon as the rice is done cooking. Do NOT wait until the rice cools down.</p>
            <p>5.Mix your rice and coconut milk very well using a spoon until the rice grains breakdown and everything sticks together. You can transfer the rice to a banana leaf or a tray at this point and shape it. But if you still get the raw coconut milk smell, turn on the heat back again and cook for about 2- 3 more minutes on the stove or in the rice cooker. If you’re using an instant pot, press the “Keep warm” option and leave it covered for about 5 - 8 mins</p>
